# Nackademin frontend-1 Individuelt arbete

## Description
To get started, just run the html file.
This project is a search for matches on user input criteria (any).
This can be used, for example, to parse a large number of files and display matches for a key input word.
My application looks for matches on any keyword, character, number, the actual keyword can be anything.
You do not need to store json files in a certain place for the script to work, you choose which files to upload yourself
after you click on the file upload button, the number of files is also not limited.
Structure:
```
index.html
script.js
```


## How to use
Select the json files you want to use by clicking on the file selection button

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/q9hVMC9/selected.png" alt="selected" border="0"></a>

Then hover over the search button and enter the word you want to find in all files.

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Ybmzby3/search.png" alt="search" border="0"></a>

Then click on the search button (magnifying glass) and you will get the result, if no matches are found, the table will not be created.

## How to optimize the code for your needs.
You need JSON files with data, and from that data you can choose which type of values you want to base your search on.
To correct work, you need to change the properties by which the data is output, in order to do this you need to change the "keys" by which you will display the data you need.
The data output function is called renderFound() 
[...] is rest operator on JavaScript.
```
const renderFound = ({firstname, lastname, belongsTo, discord, github, personalityType, skills, positiveExperience, explanation, ...item}, catched) => {
    place.innerHTML += `<tr>
                        <td>${firstname} ${lastname}</td>
                        <td>${catched} ${search}</td>
                        <td>${belongsTo}</td>
                        <td>${discord}</td>
                        <td>${github}</td>
                        <td>${personalityType}</td>
                        <td>${skills}</td>
                        <td>${positiveExperience}</td>
                        <td>${explanation}</td>
                        </tr>`;
```
example:
Suppose you have several json files that contain keys = "name" and you want to display all name matches in these files, in that case, do the following.
```
const renderFound = ({name, ...item}, catched) => {
    place.innerHTML += `<tr>
                        <td>${name}</td>
                        <td>${catched} ${search}</td>
                        </tr>`;
```
OR without rest operator:
```
const renderFound = (item, catched) => {
    place.innerHTML += `<tr>
                        <td>${item.name}</td>
                        <td>${catched} ${search}</td>
                        </tr>`;
```
You can also change the names of the tables to fit your data.
```
<form class="table_container" name="table_create">
    <table id="table">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Match</th>
            <th>Matched by</th>
            <th>Grupp</th>
            <th>Discord</th>
            <th>Github</th>
            <th>PersonalityType</th>
            <th>Skills</th>
            <th>PositiveExperience</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
```
